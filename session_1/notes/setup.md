# Machine Learning with scikit-learn and Keras
This course attempts to teach students the basics of machine learning. By the end of the course, students should be able to write simple machine/deep learning systems. The course aims to hands on driven.

Starter pack for the course: [GitHub - mrzzy/MLCourseStarterPack: Starter Pack for Machine Learning Course](https://github.com/mrzzy/MLCourseStarterPack.git)

### Pre-Course 
Complete before starting demos in lessons:
1. Install miniconda: [Miniconda â€” Conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
2. Run `conda create -n ml python=3.6`
3. Run `conda activate ml`
4. Clone or download the [course starter pack](https://github.com/mrzzy/MLCourseStarterPack.git)
5. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Install word word vectors using `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
## Sessions Breakdown
### Session I - Fundementals of Machine Learning
0. What is Machine Learning
1. Basics of Data Science (_Boston Housing_)
    - reading and selecting data with **pandas**
    - visualising data with **matplotlib**
    - vectorised arithmatic and statistics with **numpy*
2. Fundermentals of Machine Learning (_Boston Housing_)
    - Defining a good fit to data
    - Measuring fit with cost functions.
    - Training a model to fit the data
    - Overfitting and underfitting the data
    - Testing a model with cross validation
3. Applying Machine Learning (_Trump Chatbot_)
    - Defining the problem to see how ML can help
    - Feature extraction for Text with **scikit-learn**
    - Applying the model to the project.
